# Godecahedron

A from-scratch Minecraft: Java Edition server.

## Goals:
I don't plan for this to match vanilla gameplay perfectly, nor to be production-ready, but I'd like to see what's possible, so I just want to be able to connect to this server and play Minecraft in some form.

## Is this affiliated in any way with Minecraft, Microsoft, or Mojang?
No.

## Why the name?
Godecahedron was picked because dodecahedrons have got 12 faces, yet cubes just have 6, so they must be better, and I'm writing this with Golang.
